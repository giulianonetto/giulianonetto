## Giuliano Netto Flores Cruz

Hi! Iâ€™m Giuliano, a PhD student in statistics in [the Korthauer](https://www.korthauerlab.com/) lab at The University of British Columbia (UBC). I am interested in developing and applying computational tools to high-dimensional biological problems, clinical prediction modelling, Bayesian statistics, and decision analysis. I am also a bioinformatics scientist at BiomeHub, a biotech startup in Brazil, where I provide statistical guidance for clinical microbiome research and write production-ready software for omics data analysis. I earned my MSc in bioinformatics from UBC, also in the Korthauer lab, and my title of pharmacist from the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), in Brazil.
